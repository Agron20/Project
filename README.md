# Raspberry Pi Facial Recognition Project

Materials: Raspberry Pi 3 B+, Pi_Camera, LED, Fan, Buzzer, Step Motor

Face Detection folder is completed, detects face, eyes and smile, while you are on front of camera.

Face Recognition folder: When the face is recognised from the dataset then 
turns on an LED, Buzzer, fan and a stepper motor

I am working on the program to turn on a buzzer when the face is not recognised after a time limit.
The file where I was working for that is 4_facial_req_timer.py on face_recognition folder
